# The Essence of Creativity is Creating ... Begin By Creating Yourself

You have a Creator who created you in that Creator's image ... LOVE your Creator by doing the best job that you can to create yourself.

# Don't Worry, As Long As You Keep The Channel Open [Through Prayer] Your Creator Will Keep You On Track

Whether you accept it or not, the fact of your very existence is that YOU are part of the creative flow of your Creator ... but it ONLY can matter to you, if you develop a constant prayerful relationship with your Creator ... and we should never forget that this is a matter of submission and listening rather than a matter of commanding or begging/receiving.

## BE Stronger, more courageous, less afraid

This whole existence is all about [Joshua 1.9](https://www.biblestudytools.com/joshua/1-9-compare.html) ... things are already set in motion, you have been commanded and you should choose to be as courageous as possible, ie it's okay to be damned afraid and kind of scared out of your wits -- so it's just fine to fake to courage even when you can't exactly be filled with as much courageous as you would like.

This whole existence is about the creative flow of BECOMING.
