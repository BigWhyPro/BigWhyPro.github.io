# The Full Ishikawa of WHYS or Interest Shaping My WHY

Building an Ishikawa (fishbone) cause-and-effect diagram to visually map out the 10 top-priority facets (or "little WHYS") that support your larger agenda (the "BIG WHY") is a fantastic way to organize and prioritize the contributing factors to your overarching goal. Success coaches, such as those in personal development, business strategy, or productivity, have long emphasized structured approaches to breaking down complex goals into actionable components. Below, I’ll suggest various methods to construct this diagram based on their contributions, provide examples of where similar approaches have been applied, and highlight tools that can help you stay focused on advancing your BIG WHY.

## Methods for Creating an Ishikawa Diagram for Your BIG WHY

### 6M Framework (Adapted for Personal Success)  

Origin: Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa’s traditional 6M categories (Manpower, Methods, Machines, Materials, Measurement, Mother Nature) are widely used in quality control but can be adapted for personal or professional goals.  

How to Apply: Reframe the 6Ms to fit your agenda—e.g., Mindset (Manpower), Methods (Strategies), Mechanisms (Tools/Resources), Milestones (Materials), Metrics (Measurement), and Momentum (Mother Nature, or environmental factors). Identify your BIG WHY (e.g., "Launch a successful coaching business") as the head of the fish, then brainstorm 10 little WHYS under these categories (e.g., "Develop a growth mindset," "Create a marketing plan," "Use a CRM tool").  

Visual: Draw a spine with six ribs, each labeled with an adapted "M," and branch off your 10 priority facets as sub-causes.

### 5 Whys + Fishbone Hybrid  

Origin: Rooted in Toyota’s problem-solving methodology, the 5 Whys technique digs deeper into causes and has been popularized by success coaches like Tony Robbins for uncovering core motivations.  

How to Apply: Start with your BIG WHY as the effect (e.g., "Become a thought leader"). Ask "Why?" five times to drill down to root motivations (e.g., "To inspire others" → "To share expertise" → "To build credibility"). Then, map these insights onto a fishbone, assigning your 10 little WHYS (e.g., "Write a book," "Speak at events") to categories like Skills, Network, Content, and Visibility.  

Visual: The head is your BIG WHY, with ribs representing categories derived from your 5 Whys analysis, and sub-branches listing actionable facets.

### SMART Goal Categorization  

Origin: Success coaches like Brian Tracy and Zig Ziglar emphasize SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) to ensure clarity and focus.  

How to Apply: Define your BIG WHY as a SMART goal (e.g., "Increase revenue by 50% in 12 months"). Identify 10 little WHYS as sub-goals (e.g., "Launch a new product," "Upskill in sales") and group them into categories like Revenue Streams, Skills, Systems, and Relationships. Each little WHY should align with SMART criteria.  

Visual: The fishbone’s head is the SMART BIG WHY, with ribs as categories and sub-branches as SMART-aligned little WHYS.

### Mind Mapping to Fishbone Transition  

Origin: Tony Buzan’s mind mapping technique, embraced by coaches like Michael Hyatt, starts with free-form brainstorming before organizing ideas hierarchically.  

How to Apply: Brainstorm freely around your BIG WHY (e.g., "Live a balanced life"), jotting down all related ideas. Narrow these to 10 priority facets (e.g., "Exercise daily," "Meditate," "Set boundaries"), then organize them into a fishbone with categories like Health, Mindset, Time, and Support.  

Visual: Convert the mind map’s central idea (BIG WHY) into the fish head, with main branches as ribs and sub-ideas as little WHYS.

### Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)  

Origin: Vilfredo Pareto’s principle, popularized by coaches like Tim Ferriss, suggests 20% of efforts yield 80% of results.  

How to Apply: Identify your BIG WHY (e.g., "Build a global brand"). List all possible contributing tasks, then prioritize the 10 little WHYS that will drive the most impact (e.g., "Create flagship content," "Partner with influencers"). Group them into categories like Product, Outreach, and Operations.  

Visual: The head is your BIG WHY, with ribs representing high-impact categories and sub-branches as the top 10 facets.

### Wheel of Life Integration  

Origin: Used by life coaches like Paul J. Meyer, the Wheel of Life assesses balance across life areas (e.g., Career, Health, Relationships).  

How to Apply: Define your BIG WHY as an overarching life goal (e.g., "Achieve fulfillment"). Assess your Wheel of Life, then select 10 little WHYS across key areas (e.g., "Advance career," "Improve fitness," "Nurture family ties") and map them onto a fishbone with ribs like Personal Growth, Professional Success, and Connections.  

Visual: The head is the BIG WHY, with ribs as life areas and sub-branches as prioritized facets.

### Reverse Engineering Approach  

Origin: Coaches like Anik Singal advocate working backward from the end goal to identify steps.  

How to Apply: Start with your BIG WHY (e.g., "Retire early"). Imagine the end state, then reverse-engineer 10 little WHYS (e.g., "Save 20% of income," "Invest in real estate") grouped into categories like Finance, Skills, and Lifestyle.  

Visual: The fish head is the BIG WHY, with ribs as reverse-engineered categories and sub-branches as actionable steps.

## 3 Examples of Where This Has Been Done

### Mazda Miata Design (Manufacturing)  

Mazda used an Ishikawa diagram during the Miata’s development to ensure a driver-centric sports car. The BIG WHY was "Create an iconic vehicle," with little WHYS like "Optimize door design" and "Enhance handling" mapped across categories like Engineering, Aesthetics, and User Experience. This proactive use prevented issues and aligned priorities.

### Healthcare Quality Improvement (Nyaho Medical Centre)  

Nyaho Medical Centre in Ghana applied a fishbone diagram to reduce needlestick injuries (BIG WHY: "Improve staff safety"). Little WHYS like "Increase training" and "Improve equipment" were categorized under Manpower, Equipment, and Procedures, driving a successful campaign.

### Personal Productivity (Tim Ferriss’ 4-Hour Workweek)  

While not explicitly diagrammed, Ferriss’ methodology reflects a fishbone-like structure. His BIG WHY ("Live a liberated life") breaks into little WHYS (e.g., "Automate income," "Eliminate time-wasters") across categories like Business, Time, and Lifestyle, a model individuals adapt visually.

### Tony Robbins’ Business Mastery  

Robbins uses cause-and-effect thinking to help entrepreneurs achieve their BIG WHY (e.g., "Scale my business"). Participants map little WHYS like "Build a team" and "Refine marketing" onto frameworks resembling fishbones, with categories like Leadership, Systems, and Growth.

## Putting It Together: A Practical Example

Imagine your BIG WHY is "Launch a thriving podcast." Using the 6M adaptation:  

Head: "Launch a thriving podcast."  
Ribs and Little WHYS:  
Mindset: "Cultivate confidence," "Stay consistent."  
Methods: "Develop episode structure," "Plan content calendar."  
Mechanisms: "Buy quality mic," "Use editing software."  
Milestones: "Record first episode," "Reach 1,000 downloads."  
Metrics: "Track listener growth," "Measure engagement."  
Momentum: "Build a supportive network."

Draw this on paper or in Lucidchart, then use Trello to assign tasks and deadlines for each little WHY, keeping your focus aligned with the BIG WHY.

These methods, examples, and tools draw from decades of success coaching wisdom, offering you a robust framework to visualize and execute your agenda effectively.
