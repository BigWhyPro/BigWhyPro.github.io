*If your Creator rests only the Sabbath, then why aren't you creating every day? How did you become so sedentary, so FRAIL?*

# Make this Fraility Index YOURS

The Frality Index [FI] that I am developing WILL change ... it is in an EARLY STATE OF DEVELOPMENT ... this post is only about the gist of the theory behind this fraility index.

The medical profession has all kinds of suggested screenings and various sorts of bloodwork that are recommended ... based on the fact that these things generate revenue and keep labs and hospital beds at capacity.

To its credit, the medical profession developed several FRAILITY INDEX metrics, for example [see link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4499935/) ... you can look at medical literature on various different fraility indices, but a consistent self-serving pattern still emerges ... the medical FI almost always based upon bloodwork or some sort of professional assessment, eg, probing by a professional in  a clinic's anal love nest, which is calculated to result in more trips to the doctor or more swallowing of the pharmaceuticals.

My fraility index is much more INTENTLY practical ... it's kind of simple, but it's difficult in practice to stay on top of CONSISTENTLY ... because it is not an automated gadget [although it can incorporate data from gadgets] because it's based on human body measurement equipment, ie a trained, motivated brain connected to an actual aging body in various states of eustress, stress and pain ... the system uses the stuff which we are all born with, but it requires that we USE the equipment and pay attention to our intentions and exertion as we use it.



1) Bible study, prayer, meditation ... is a guy spiritually healthy being in a state of constant prayer with daily devotions, bible study and shared, but direct application of faith OR is a guy frail and dependent upon seeing a professional religious specialist?

2) Ordinarily, but irregularly varying levels of stress and activity.  When it snows, can a guy shovel his own sidewalks and driveways OR has he let his shoulders atrophy so that he needs a snowblower OR service that provides snow removal services?  Does a guy lift weights or engage in other kinds of exercise in order to be ready for snowstorms, floods, clean-up after tornadoes OR is a guy frail and dependent upon others?

3) Ordinary, daily/weekly levels of activity. Can a guy mow his lawn with a reel mower OR does he need a rider to haul his fat ass around or does he hire a lawnmowing service to come in and remove the grass and clippings. Can a guy work on his landscaping with spades, shovels, trip loopers, pruning shears, tree saws, axes, kukri, mattocks and wheelbarrow OR does he use a contractor with a skidsteers, trailers, various equipment like tree spades, stump chewers or trenchers to dig in the irrigation system?

4) Gratitude for creation ... can a guy enjoying the community he lives in but walking 5-10 miles a day pushing into Zone II level of exertion [where talking is possible in theory, but not comfortable in practice, thus brief, concise and only to-the-point] without being reminded that he should try to get a little exercise OR ... to put it a different way, how many days per month does a guy use his vehicle or his XUV to haul his fat ass to do errands which are mostly tied in some way to his visits to the anal love nest or some other "wellness" appointment?

5) Home maintenance and repairs, routine construction projects

6) Housework, cleaning, orderliness, 5S activities

7) Does a guy do at least 30 minutes of cardio six days a week, eg 8 4-minute HIIT Tabatas of intense exercise to push a guy to Zone V [highest level of exertion].

8) Does a guy roll on the mats every day doing solo drills and expanding his repertoire of new solo drills.

9) Does a guy use his heavy bag to routinely do high impact exercises to ensure that bone mass does not fade away, that tendon and joints stay pliable and callouses on knuckles do not disappear OR does a guy rely on the sheriff's deputies to show up when he dials 911?

10) Does a guy start new things, new ventures, new philanthropic projects, new activities which require Christian leadership and examples of Christian service to larger audiences?
