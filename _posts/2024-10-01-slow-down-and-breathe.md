# The BigWhy App HAS TO BE META AI Driven

It's not just that *everyone* is already asking AI questions ... and that *everyone* already understands the importance of prompt engineering, LangGraph, et al.

Ok ... maybe almost *everyone* needs a **bit** of primer on how to USE AI effectively, optimally ... but the Big WHY App is about keeping all of the WHYS supporting the BIG WHY aligned ... so that one isn't off in the weeds, chasing something new and shiny.

The BIG WHY is about STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT ... and USING the tools, best practices, best ideas to work on that strategic alignment.

We can best illustrate how to USE AI by looking at how we use AI to develop the expertise to SLOW DOWN AND BREATHE.

## Slow down and just BREATHE

Let's work on breathwork ... and let's USE AI to help us autodidactically become much more knowledgeable about breathwork ... so that we can *at least* begin to formulate the kinds of questions that we might ask of a respiratory physiologist and breathwork specialist an intelligent question about improving our own breathwork practice.
