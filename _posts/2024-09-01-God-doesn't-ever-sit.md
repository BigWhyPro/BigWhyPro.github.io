# What Does "I AM" Mean?

We can infer that, I AM, the *name* that God uses for God means that God ***IS*** CREATION ... in Exodus 3:14 God reveals to Moses that GOD *is* **I AM** ... God is EVERYTHING that is happening as the creation of everything unfolds.

God is about CREATIVE [***flow***](https://youtu.be/7dSzKnf5WWg) ... by being in a state of FLOW, we mean that God is not at all struggling, but rather infinitely productive over a vast realm and immensely positive and loving and constantly encouraging of the creativity of His created beings.

It also means that God is not remotely as sedentary as human beings are. **God doesn't EVER sit!!!**
