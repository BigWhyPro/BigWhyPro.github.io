# The BigWhy App HAS TO BE META AI Driven

It's not just that *everyone* is already asking AI questions ... and that *everyone* already understands the importance of prompt engineering, LangGraph, et al.

Ok ... maybe almost *everyone* needs a **bit** of primer on how to USE AI effectively, optimally ... but the Big WHY App is about keeping all of the WHYS supporting the BIG WHY aligned ... so that one isn't off in the weeds, chasing something new and shiny.

The BIG WHY is about STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT ... and USING the tools, best practices, best ideas to work on that strategic alignment.
