# Why Bother Working On Your Discipline

Working on your discipline is ONLY thing that you really have in this existence.

To make a long story short ... you really don't ***have to*** work on your discipline ... you can just coast and then die.

If you don't want to work on your discipline any more, you can completely *check out*.


# Healthy Habits Are NECESSARILY going to suck

If you want to create things ... you have to start by creating yourself ... and you should understand, that when you really depart from faking life and start creating an original you, people [who ***just settle***] for just being spectators, just watching vids/teevee, just going along with the other tourists ... the people who ***SETTLE*** rather than create their own existences will let you know that they are displeased by you not being the person they knew before ... HEALTH HABITS are NECESSARILY going to suck and that includes all of the people [including your former self] who look at you and are TOTALLY SCARED of your creativity. 

It's HEALTHY to minimize the less than creative voices in your head.
