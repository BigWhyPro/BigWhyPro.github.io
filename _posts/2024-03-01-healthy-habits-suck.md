# Why Bother Working On Your Discipline?

Working on your discipline is ONLY thing that you really have in this existence.

To make a long story short ... you really don't ***have to*** work on your discipline ... you can just sorta coast, get more and more miserable and then eventually die.

If you just do not want to work on your discipline any more, you can completely *check out* ... that is an option.

Our work on our discipline is what defines our lives ... if you want to have a modicum of freedom, you must have discipline to fight and die fighting for what you believe in. Without discipline, there is no freedom ... you're just a product of some induced whim ... it's not just that you have zero control over your destiny -- you also have zero control over how you react to or handle situations. 

Time is your only asset ... but how you use that time, determines the value of that asset FOR YOUR PURPOSES ... you do not have and should not ever worry about maximizing your time's value for someone else -- you have to continually develop the discipline to make your time valuable to yourself, so that you can be an asset to others who matter, ie purely needy people who never grow up are never going to matter to anybody. **YOUR only chance at fulfillment and freedom in life is to** ***USE*** **your time in disciplined manner according to your values, goals and faith**. 

This is why we will repetitiously say over and over in the BIG WHY project that *it is up to YOU to* **define** your BIG WHY ... nobody can develop your discipline for you.*


# Healthy Habits Are NECESSARILY going to suck

If you want to create things ... you have to start by creating yourself ... and you should understand, that when you really depart from faking life and start creating an original you, people [who ***just settle***] for just being spectators, just watching vids/teevee, just going along with the other tourists ... the people who ***SETTLE*** rather than create their own existences will let you know that they are displeased by you not being the person they knew before ... HEALTH HABITS are NECESSARILY going to suck and that includes all of the people [including your former self] who look at you and are TOTALLY SCARED of your creativity. 

It's HEALTHY to minimize the less than creative voices in your head.
