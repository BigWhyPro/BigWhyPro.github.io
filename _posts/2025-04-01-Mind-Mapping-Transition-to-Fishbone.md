# The Full Ishikawa of WHYS or Interest Shaping My WHY

Building an Ishikawa (fishbone) cause-and-effect diagram to visually map out the 10 top-priority facets (or "little WHYS") that support your larger agenda (the "BIG WHY") is a fantastic way to organize and prioritize the contributing factors to your overarching goal. Success coaches, such as those in personal development, business strategy, or productivity, have long emphasized structured approaches to breaking down complex goals into actionable components. Below, I’ll suggest various methods to construct this diagram based on their contributions, provide examples of where similar approaches have been applied, and highlight tools that can help you stay focused on advancing your BIG WHY.

## Methods for Creating an Ishikawa Diagram for Your BIG WHY

### 6M Framework ... Adapted to 10M ... for MZB's mission, personal goals. 

Origin: Dr. Kaoru Ishikawa’s traditional 6M categories (Manpower, Methods, Machines, Materials, Measurement, Mother Nature) are widely used in quality control but I have adapted and granulated these to 10M ... to drive my priorities ... or the little WHY priorities which support my BIG WHY.

My 10M are MINDSET, MEETING, MACHINES, MOBILITY, MELONCAVE, MATRICULATION, MINDFULNESS, MOMENTUM, MONEY, MAINTENANCE.  

How to Apply: Reframe the 10Ms to fit your agenda My priorities ... or little WHYS supporting my BIG WHY ... are MINDSET, MEETING, MACHINES, MOBILITY, MELONCAVE, MATRICULATION, MINDFULNESS, MOMENTUM, MONEY, MAINTENANCE. Identify your BIG WHY (e.g., "LIVING The Creator's Will For My Life") as the head of the fish, then articulate 10 priorities or little WHYS under these categories.  

Visual: Sketch a spine with 10 ribs in your Journal or on a sketch pad, each labeled with an adapted "M," and branch each off into 10 sub-priority facets as sub-causes ... it might work best to have 11 sketches; the main one and 10 little why sub-fishbones for your priority ... the sketch will get plenty messy, and you'll need to do it several times, but the point is to manually think through the process, not to produce a nice sketch ... the deliverable output that you want is in the form of clearly defined, concretely articulated SMART objectives for each of the 10M

### 5 Whys + Fishbone Hybrid  

Origin: Rooted in Toyota’s problem-solving methodology, the 5 Whys technique digs deeper into causes and has been popularized by success coaches like Tony Robbins for uncovering core motivations.  

How to Apply: Start with your BIG WHY as the effect (e.g., "LIVING The Creator's Will For My Life"). Ask "Why?" five or ten times to drill down to root motivations (e.g., "To inspire others" → "To share expertise" → "To build credibility"). Then, map these insights back onto your fishbones, assigning your 10 little WHYS (e.g., MINDSET, MEETING, MACHINES, MOBILITY, MELONCAVE, MATRICULATION, MINDFULNESS, MOMENTUM, MONEY, MAINTENANCE) back into actionable tasks, todo lists, daily chores, and perhaps categories like Skills, Network, Content, and Visibility.  

Visual: The head is your BIG WHY, with ribs representing categories derived from your 5 Whys analysis, and sub-branches listing actionable plans or agendas ... the deliverable output that you want is in the form of clearly defined, concretely articulated ACTION PLAN ... that helps you to make measurable progress everyday toward a bigger SMART objectives for each of the 10M

### SMART Goal Categorization  

Origin: All kinds of different success coaches like Brian Tracy and Zig Ziglar emphasize SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) again and again ... the redundancy might get old, but it's always about ensuring clarity and hammering on focus and discipline.  

How to Apply: Define your BIG WHY as a SMART goal (e.g., "During my personal Holy Hour ritual, observed every morning at 4 AM, I will explicitly state what I am GRATEFUL for, because I know that for me, gratitude is the fundamental indicator that I am living in accordance with my Creator's Will"). It is also important to identify 10 supporting SMART OBJECTIVES for each of the 10 little WHYS ... these 10 Smart Objectives will also have SMART sub-goals (e.g., "Launch a new podcast," "Upskill in open source community building") and, if it helps to work on related things together, group them into categories like Revenue Streams, Skills, Systems, and Relationships. Each sub-goal needs to align with the SMART criteria for each 10M Priorities.  

Visual: The fishbone’s head is the SMART BIG WHY, with ribs as categories and sub-branches as SMART-aligned Priorites supporting the Big Why, ie the "little" WHYS.

### Mind Mapping to Fishbone Transition  

Origin: Tony Buzan’s mind mapping technique, embraced by coaches like Michael Hyatt, starts with free-form brainstorming before organizing ideas hierarchically.  

How to Apply: Brainstorm freely and wildly around your BIG WHY (e.g., "LIVING The Creator's Will For My Life"), jotting down all related ideas ... perhaps during the part of the day when you do Gratitude Journaling. Over time you will notices recurrent narratives that are emerging as you grapple with the difficulties of achieving your SMART goals and priorities ... narrow these to 10 priority facets (e.g., "Exercise daily," "Meditate," "Set boundaries"), then organize them into a re-organized fishbone with categories that emerge like Health, Mindset, Time, and Support.  

Visual: Convert the mind map’s central idea (BIG WHY) into a re-imagined fishbone, with different main branches as ribs and sub-ideas as little WHYS.

### Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)  

Origin: Vilfredo Pareto’s principle, popularized by coaches like Tim Ferriss, suggests 20% of efforts yield 80% of results ... that's an understatement ... it's actually probably more like 5% yield 95% of the results in some cases ... it's generally more important to REMOVE impediments rather than to ADD bandaids, paint, or perfume to make the problem less noticeable. 

How to Apply: Identify your BIG WHY (e.g., "LIVING The Creator's Will For My Life"). DISCERNING the Creator's will is a lot tougher than it first appears -- it takes a lifetime! In applying the 80/20 rule, you will want to list all possible contributing tasks, then prioritize the key 10 Priorities that will drive the most impact (e.g., "Renounce and end the bad habits of being myself."). Group them into categories like Product, Outreach, and Operations, if that grouping helps.  

Visual: The head is your BIG WHY, with ribs representing high-impact categories and sub-branches as the top 10 Priorities ... remember, most of the time, it's going to be about the stupid shit that you stop defending and start to REMOVE.

### Wheel of Life Integration  

Origin: Used by life coaches like Paul J. Meyer, the Wheel of Life assesses balance across life areas (e.g., Career, Health, Relationships).  

How to Apply: Define your BIG WHY as an overarching life goal (e.g., "LIVING The Creator's Will For My Life"). Try to look at your life as an alien from another galaxy -- assess the well-roundedness and balance of your Wheel of Life, then select 10 Priorities across key areas (e.g., "Advance career," "Improve fitness," "Nurture family ties") and map them onto a fishbone with ribs like Personal Growth, Professional Success, and Connections or different categories that make sense to you.  

Visual: The head is the BIG WHY, with ribs as life areas and sub-branches as prioritized facets.

### Reverse Engineering Approach  

Origin: Coaches like Anik Singal advocate working backward from the end goal to identify steps.  

How to Apply: Start with your BIG WHY (e.g., "LIVING The Creator's Will For My Life"). Imagine the PERFECT end state, then reverse-engineer what 10 Priorities would have looked like for the person that achieved that outcome (e.g., "Life characterized GRATITUDE and Adoration, rather than worries," maybe there are heroes or saints that you find worthy of imitation) ... again theses will be grouped into categories that emerge from the exercise, like maybe Competence, Teaching Others, and Healthy Lifestyle.  

Visual: The fish head is the BIG WHY, with ribs as reverse-engineered categories and sub-branches as actionable steps.

## 3 Examples of Where This Has Been Done

### Mazda Miata Design (Manufacturing)  

Mazda used an Ishikawa diagram during the Miata’s development to ensure a driver-centric sports car. The BIG WHY was "Create an iconic vehicle," with little WHYS like "Optimize door design" and "Enhance handling" mapped across categories like Engineering, Aesthetics, and User Experience. This proactive use prevented issues and aligned priorities.

### Healthcare Quality Improvement (Nyaho Medical Centre)  

Nyaho Medical Centre in Ghana applied a fishbone diagram to reduce needlestick injuries (BIG WHY: "Improve staff safety"). Little WHYS like "Increase training" and "Improve equipment" were categorized under Manpower, Equipment, and Procedures, driving a successful campaign.

### Personal Productivity (Tim Ferriss’ 4-Hour Workweek)  

While not explicitly diagrammed, Ferriss’ methodology reflects a fishbone-like structure. His BIG WHY ("Live a liberated life") breaks into little WHYS (e.g., "Automate income," "Eliminate time-wasters") across categories like Business, Time, and Lifestyle, a model individuals adapt visually.

### Tony Robbins’ Business Mastery  

Robbins uses cause-and-effect thinking to help entrepreneurs achieve their BIG WHY (e.g., "Scale my business"). Participants map little WHYS like "Build a team" and "Refine marketing" onto frameworks resembling fishbones, with categories like Leadership, Systems, and Growth.

## Putting It Together: The MZB Example

Imagine ... for the sake of illustrating this example that your BIG WHY is "LIVING The Creator's Will For My Life" using MZB's 10M adaptation:  


1) MINDSET ... 24% of my waking energy/focus/time or 27 hours/week, 12 on Sunday and 2 1/2 hours of every other day is allocated to keeping the Sabbath holy, keeping holy hour holy upon waking, attending Mass, bible study, journaling and [spiritual health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/Spiritual/). Sharpening the axe or MINDSET is easily my favorite part of life! I sort of have to try not to spend all of my time on my highest priority because if I neglect the other areas, they have ways of becoming urgent and demanding ... but a spiritual MINDSET is everything.

2) MEETING ... 13% of my energy/focus/time or 14 hours/week, 2 hrs/day, goes to **MEETING new friends** and finding new colleagues, primarily NEW interactions/outreach through philanthropic ventures and open source, community devotions and Bible Study, messaging and taking the time to comment on posts/tweets [new acquaintances as well assustaining old friendships], but it is mostly everything that is of a exploratory social nature that drives my [emotional health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/2/)

3) MACHINES ... 11% of my energy/focus/time or 12 hours/week or 2 hours/weekday goes to working on tools to automate ... such as AI, neural networks, deep learning development, and various activities that use my capabilities and sustain my [cognitive health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/3/). To a large degree, BigWhy is entirely about SUSTAINING cognitive health ... but learning these new things is also building tools that advance the cause of supporting basis of meeting new friends OR engaging in meaningful spiritual dialogue.

4) MOBILITY ... 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/week or 90 minutes/weekday goes to staying active, gardening, landscaping, different forms of exercise but ensuring that I get at least 30 minutes of Zone 2 exercise to sustain better levels of VO2max. Diet for me is mostly about what I remove, but I need to work at getting most of emotional support from things like martial arts solo drills, weight lifting, mobility drills to maintain my [physical health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/4/), so that I can have a decent level of cognitive, emotional, spiritual health.

5) MELONCAVE ... some would call it "*downright MEANNESS*" ... 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/day or an 90 minutes/weekday is stopping the bad habits of being myself, renunciation of stupidity as well as removing crutches and little bad habits ...  the unusual name of MELON CAVE, has its name derived from *caving in the melon of the personal demon driving the bad habits* because getting rid of the bad habits of being ourselves HAS TO be a brutal, take-no-prisoners, accept-nocompromises, ***fight-to-the-absolute-death*** *with that personal demon* ... in my case, I know that bad habit demon is not going to die, unless I personally slay it ... *really* getting rid of one's bad habits *ain't for sissies* ... and we're not talking things somebody would like to change -- we're talking about things that I NEED to change, or else those things are going to compromise our ability to make progress on our other priorities ...that's why it requires a FIGHT ... starting with example of fasting challenges, eg Lent and not just other parts of a fast-mimicking lifestyles but more time in prayer/contemplation rather than eating, optimizing biochemistry by cutting out the crap ... this but avoids most additives and supplements ... being sure to get the just right amount of sunlight, and all kinds of "cave in the melon" of my personal demons driving my bad habits or [renunciation of comfort, laziness and gluttony](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/5/).

6) MATRICULATION [and measuring]... 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/week or an 90 minutes/day is allocated to autodidactic learning, which means studying completely new topics, reading pre-print papers and [gathering new business/tech intelligence](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/6/). If I don't spend the time matriculating and measuring my success in learning something [by making something work, passing a certification exam or some other measurement traceable to a verifiable standard] then all kinds of things fall apart, eg I can't meet new people; I can't maintain my stuff, I can't work on AI/machines to make my life easier.

7) MINDFULNESS ... 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/week goes or 90 minutes/day to improving my mindfulness, coherence, clarity and cognitive awareness [of my cognitive awareness] to ensure that I stay on the path to becoming the kind of person that I want to be ... MINDFULNESS is primarily about meditative prayer walks and a range of meditation and breathwork exercises in my [Christiaan Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/7/) repertoire.

8) MOMENTUM ... 6% of my energy/focus/time or 7 hours/week or an hour/day goes to maintaining momentum and that comes through [sleep hygiene and everything necessary to ensure good rest](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/8/).  This was not always obvious, ie I used to be one of those "I sleep when I'm dead" kind of guys, but good sleep is about allowing the subconscious brain to rest and unravel all of the knots, paradoxes and puzzles. Getting good sleep for me depends upon *having my house in order* so that I can just sleep; doing this is just simply little average things like  5S activities, putting my tools and books and stuff in order, puttering in my kitchen or garage, various housekeeping chores and everything else that I need do beforehand to put my life in order to set the stage for optimizing my sleep during the 56 hrs/week I spend sleeping.

9) MONEY ... 6% of my energy/focus/time or 7 hours/week or an hour/day is devoted to correspondence, business, bills, managing investments, taxes and [financial health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/9/). I do not enjoy this part of the day, at all -- except for getting it done. I basically hate money and detest spending time with people who chase money, but I gotta *keep the lights on* and pay my bills. I wish I could spend zero time to this chore ... but it has to be taken care of, or else ...

10) MAINTENANCE ... About 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/week ... 1 per weekday and 3 on Sunday, since Sunday is my "wrap my head around the bs and sort through the stuff causing chaos day" ... you could also say that this is my MISCELLANEOUS JUNK box to collect everything that doesn't fit into the other priorities ... MAINTENANCE is for the stuff that I didn't really plan or think about before, but things have a way of bubbling up -- so I need to acknowledge that some of my time is just going to need to go to uncategorized miscellaneous stuff to sort through and address ... it's not all bad, many more unexpected GREAT things pop up than negative ones ... but the surprises that have to be planned/timeblocked and [miscellaneous things that haven't yet forced me to re-categorize my 9 priorities](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/A/). These surprises can be ignored if they are not important -- but if they actually are important, they will be urgent [and maybe BAD] when they arise again ... the time *lost* to these things is significant enough to demand it's own miscellaneous class, but they just don't neatly really fit under the other headings.
