# Gratitude HAS TO define your day.

ESPECIALLY on those days when you imagine that you're having a hard time thinking of something to be grateful for.

Of course, you could just start with the fact that you're alive and the other things that you have journalled about being grateful for before ... but that's not really going to be good enough ... EVERY SINGLE DAY you need to be grateful for something NEW, something you have not really thought about before.

There will be something NEW ... EVERY SINGLE DAY ... and you will need to develop the discipline of thinking of something NEW every day to be grateful for.

When we say that "***Gratitude HAS TO define your day.***", we mean that you need to have the discipline of waking up knowing that **you OWE your Creator a genuine expression of gratitude and thanks for something new every day.**
