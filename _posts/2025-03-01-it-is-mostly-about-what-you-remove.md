*It's mostly about what you remove.*

# Toyota Production System Refinement Hybrid Of 5 Whys + Ishikawa

Origin: Rooted in Toyota Production System’s brutally relentless problem-solving, quality and reliabiilty improvement, cost-reduction methodology, the 5 Whys technique is really harder core causal inference. Drilling down to ROOT cause is fundamentally about digging deeper into the bedrock causes than anybody really wants to study. It is almost impossibly hard and tedious, but the drive toward root cause is fundamentally about simplification and removing all of the bandaids, cover-ups, perfume, distracting hype, feature-driven marketing bs and all kinds of clever bullshit that barnacles over root causes. TPS and root cause analysis has been popularized by all kinds of different success coaches ... who tend to brand their strategy differently and sometimes add genuine value/insight ... but it is fundamentally about chipping away at the bullshit to uncover the most core of one's core motivations. That's HARD, because it is not just about doing something for the sake of trying to do something -- ***causal inference is about THINKING.***

How to Apply: Start with your BIG WHY as the effect (e.g., "LIVING The Creator's Will For My Life"). Ask "Why?" at least five ... or ten or twenty five or fifty or one hundred or a thousand times ... to really drill down to the core of the core root motivations (e.g., "To inspire others" → "To share expertise" → "To build credibility"). Then, map these insights back onto your fishbones, assigning your 10 lesser WHY causal factors (e.g., MINDSET, MEETING, MACHINES, MOBILITY, MELONCAVE, MATRICULATION, MINDFULNESS, MOMENTUM, MONEY, MAINTENANCE) back into actionable projects, broken down into doable tasks, daily todo lists of atomic, completable daily assignments and ongoing chores ... in some cases categories might emerge, with nice titles like Skills, Network, Content, and Visibility.  

Visual: It is still the same process of sketching, doodling, diagramming ... but it's about relentlessly digging much deeper, simplifying, re-digging and relentlessly removing the bullshit ... the deliverable output that you want will be in the form of clearly defined, concretely articulated ongoing ACTION PLANS ... those plans will not survive confrontation with the enemy, but as you work on them and refine them and find ways to quantify and measure your progress ... better, clearer SMART objectives for each of the causal factors will emerge.
