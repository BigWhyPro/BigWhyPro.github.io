## 10th Priority

10) About 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/week ... 1 per weekday and 3 on Sunday, since Sunday is my "wrap my head around the bs and sort through the stuff causing chaos day" ... I don't plan it, but things come up -- so I need to acknowledge that some of my time is going to go to uncategorized things to sort through, unexpected good things that pop up, surprises that have to be planned/timeblocked and [miscellaneous things that haven't yet forced me to re-categorize my 9 priorities](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/10/). These are things that are important and urgent when they arise ... the time *lost* to these things is significant, but just don't really fit under the other headings.
