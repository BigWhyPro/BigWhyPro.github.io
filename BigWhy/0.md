## What is BIG WHY

What is THE FOUNDATION of all other foundations?  What Matters More Than Anything Else In YOUR Life?

### The Creator's Will For My Life

***The essence of a warrior is never giving up on one's mission.*** 

*EACH one of us has a UNIQUE mission in life.* **We are NOT created equal.**

My own life's mission is about discerning that will of the Creator; my life has become so much better after I aggressively forced myself to stop ever worrying about my needs or wants or distractions like ego.

Since the Creator is always continuing create, re-create, resurrect and revitalize, His will must shape my objectives and goals. 

I must never look back longing for the past; I must drive forward, using the rear view mirror to improve my drive toward the objective.

## Ten Priorities

We all have priorities. The following are ONLY my personal examples which drive my own allocation of time/energy/focus. 

There are 168 hours in a week. My starting intention is to get 56 hours of spectacular sleep every week, which leaves 112 hours or 16 hours/day -- I expect to lose 1 hour/day to 10th or A priority and more on Sunday, which leaves 15 hours per day  to time-block.

1) 24% of my waking energy/focus/time or 27 hours/week, 12 on Sunday and 2 1/2 hours of every other day is allocated to keeping the Sabbath holy, keeping holy hour holy upon waking, attending Mass, bible study, journaling and [spiritual health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/Spiritual/). This is easily my favorite part of life; I sort of have to try not to spend all of my time on my highest priority because if I neglect the other areas, they have ways of becoming urgent and demanding.

2) 13% of my energy/focus/time or 14 hours/week, 2 hrs/day, goes to **meeting new friends** and finding new colleagues, new interactions/outreach through philanthropic ventures and open source, community devotions, sustaining old friendships, messaging/commenting, and everything of a exploratory social nature that drives my [emotional health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/2/)

3) 11% of my energy/focus/time or 12 hours/week or 2 hours/weekday goes to working on things like AI, neural networks, deep learning development, and [cognitive health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/3/). To a large degree, BigWhy is entirely about cognitive health ... but learning these new things is also the supporting basis of meeting new friends OR engaging in meaningful spiritual dialogue.

4) 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/week or 90 minutes/weekday goes to staying active, gardening, landscaping, different forms of exercise but ensuring that I get at least 30 minutes of Zone 2 exercise to sustain better levels of VO2max. Diet for me is mostly about what I remove, but I need to work at getting most of emotional support from things like martial arts solo drills, weight lifting, mobility drills to maintain my [physical health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/4/), so that I can have a decent level of cognitive, emotional, spiritual health.

5) 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/day or an 90 minutes/weekday is devoted to renunciation, removing crutches and bad habits, starting with examples of fasting challenges, eg Lent and other parts of a fast-mimicking lifestyles, optimizing biochemistry but avoiding most supplements, being sure to get the right amount of sunlight, and miscellaneous other things are about [renunciation of comfort, laziness and gluttony](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/5/).

6) 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/week or an 90 minutes/day is allocated to autodidactic learning, which means studying completely new topics, reading pre-print papers and [gathering new business/tech intelligence](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/6/). 

7) 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/week goes or 90 minutes/day to improving my mindfulness and cognitive awareness [to ensure that I become the kind of person that I want to be], meditative prayer walks and [Christiaan MBSR](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/7/)

8) 6% of my energy/focus/time or 7 hours/week or an hour/day goes to [sleep hygiene and everything necessary to ensure good rest](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/8/). This is nothing more than 5S activities, putting things in order, puttering with my tools, various housekeeping chores and everything else that I need do beforehand to put my life in order to set the stage for optimizing my sleep during the 56 hrs/week I spend sleeping.

9) 6% of my energy/focus/time or 7 hours/week or an hour/day is devoted to correspondence, business, bills, managing investments, taxes and [financial health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/9/). I do not enjoy this part of the day, at all -- except for getting it done; I wish I could zero time to this chore that has to be taken care of, or else ...

10) About 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/week ... 1 per weekday and 3 on Sunday, since Sunday is my "wrap my head around the bs and sort through the stuff causing chaos day" ... I don't plan it, but things come up -- so I need to acknowledge that some of my time is going to go to uncategorized things to sort through, unexpected good things that pop up, surprises that have to be planned/timeblocked and [miscellaneous things that haven't yet forced me to re-categorize my 9 priorities](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/10/). These are things that are important and urgent when they arise ... the time *lost* to these things is significant, but just don't really fit under the other headings.
