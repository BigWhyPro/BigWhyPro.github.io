## 3rd Priority

3) 11% of my energy/focus/time or 12 hours/week or 2 hours/weekday goes to working on things like AI, neural networks, deep learning development, and [cognitive health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/3/). To a large degree, BigWhy is entirely about cognitive health ... but learning these new things is also the supporting basis of meeting new friends OR engaging in meaningful spiritual dialogue.
