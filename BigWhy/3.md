## 3rd Priority MACHINES 

11% of my energy/focus/time or 12 hours/week or 2 hours/weekday goes to working on things like AI, neural networks, deep learning development, and [cognitive health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/3/). To a large degree, BigWhy is entirely about using AI and **automated** learning ... because learning, and *automated* learning which helps ME with learning these things is also the supporting basis almost everything else, especially meeting new friends OR engaging in *somewhat meaningful* spiritual dialogue with theologians, physicists or technologists/engineers like me ... I do not thoroughly enjoy AI -- instead, it's a matter of recognizing the remarkable ROI for every second spent being somewhat savvy about AI.

I mostly want to learn enough about AI technologies, algortihms, methodologies, trends in pre-print Arxiv papers to be dangerous, but not really to be competent ... right now, I'm particularly focused on the better AI assistants ... and it's not exactly the technology so much, but rather it's whether serious AI devs and savvy AI people are finding a particular provider, especially worthwhile ... so as of February 19, 2025, the following list is a teeny weeney snapshot of a ***firehose*** of recent, relevant information on emerging AI Review Platforms ... *not AI, but just the* ***REVIEW PLATFORMS***, which in turn try to digest the ***tsunami*** of new material every day on AI and AI Assistants.

### Medium, Substack, Github, [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent), et al 

Focus: These hosts numerous AI-focused pre-print papers, articles, blogs, repositories, and different AI-Focused repositories/blogs/publications, eg https://generativeai.pub/. There are *multiple* alternatives ... basically, there are way too many alternatives to begin to parse or catalog ... I have been sort of on the lookout for material, with an aim of curating a better list of [AWESOME AI](https://github.com/search?q=Awesome%20AI&type=repositories) ... but it's impossible to keep up, so I find myself looking to the catalogers/reviewers.

Relevance: These articles are highly relevant for 2025, focusing exclusively on AI and providing critical reviews of AI assistants and agents.

### [Unite.AI](https://www.unite.ai/) ... especially for it's cataloging/review of **AI tools**  

Focus: Unite.AI is a prominent platform that provides in-depth reviews, analyses, and comparisons of AI technologies, including AI assistants. As of 2025, it continues to be a go-to resource for evaluating AI tools, with a recent article titled "10 Best AI Assistants (February 2025)" highlighting top AI assistants like Alexa, Siri, and enterprise-focused tools. The platform focuses exclusively on AI innovations, offering detailed insights into performance, usability, and emerging trends in AI assistants.

Relevance: It’s dedicated to AI and regularly updates its content to reflect the latest advancements, making it a key resource for reviews of AI assistants in 2025.

### [MarkTechPost](https://www.marktechpost.com/)   

Focus: MarkTechPost is another specialized platform that reviews and discusses AI technologies, including AI assistants. Its article "Top 25 AI Assistants in 2025" (published November 2024, but relevant for 2025 trends) provides comprehensive reviews of AI assistants like Cortana, Watson Assistant, Replika, and Jasper, focusing on their capabilities, use cases, and performance in productivity, customer service, and personal companionship. The platform is exclusively dedicated to AI and machine learning, making it a valuable source for AI assistant reviews.

Relevance: It targets a tech-savvy audience and offers detailed, niche-focused reviews of AI assistants, aligning with your request for platforms focused exclusively on AI.

### [Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/)  ... especially its [in depth blogs](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/)

Focus: While primarily an educational platform for data science and AI, Analytics Vidhya also publishes reviews and trend analyses of AI technologies, including AI agents and assistants. Its article "Top 10 AI Agent Trends and Predictions for 2025" (December 2024) indirectly reviews AI assistant capabilities by discussing their evolution, such as proactive problem-solving and multi-modal features. Though not exclusively a review platform, it provides authoritative insights into AI assistants’ performance and future directions.

Relevance: It’s highly focused on AI and offers detailed evaluations of AI tools, making it relevant for understanding AI assistants in 2025.


## Key Observations

*WOW, there's a lot of stuff out there ... *

Exclusivity: Most platforms listed above are dedicated to AI and machine learning, with a significant portion of their content focusing on AI assistants, agents, and related technologies. However, there isn’t a single, widely recognized platform in 2025 that exclusively reviews AI and AI assistants without also covering broader AI trends or applications.

Emerging Trends: The reviews emphasize advancements in AI assistants, such as autonomy (e.g., agentic AI), multi-modal capabilities, and integration into enterprise workflows, reflecting the 2025 landscape as described in the search results.

Limitations: No platform identified in the search is solely a “review platform” for AI assistants in the traditional sense (e.g., like consumer product review sites). Instead, these platforms combine reviews with educational content, trend analyses, and predictions.

Additional Notes from X and Grok3 are kind of emerging as big deal ... since Grok3 attempts to stay on top of indexing the latest material on X and all of the people trying to get their material noticed tend to use X [as well as cross-post otherwhere]

## How MACHINES supports the other 9 priorities.

1) MINDSET ... 24% of my waking energy/focus/time or 27 hours/week, 12 on Sunday and 2 1/2 hours of every other day is allocated to keeping the Sabbath holy, keeping holy hour holy upon waking, attending Mass, bible study, journaling and [spiritual health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/Spiritual/). Sharpening the axe or MINDSET is easily my favorite part of life! I sort of have to try not to spend all of my time on my highest priority because if I neglect the other areas, they have ways of becoming urgent and demanding ... but a spiritual MINDSET is everything.

2) MEETING ... 13% of my energy/focus/time or 14 hours/week, 2 hrs/day, goes to **meeting new friends** and finding new colleagues, new interactions/outreach through philanthropic ventures and open source, community devotions, sustaining old friendships, messaging/commenting, and everything of a exploratory social nature that drives my [emotional health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/2/)

4) MOBILITY ... 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/week or 90 minutes/weekday goes to staying active, gardening, landscaping, different forms of exercise but ensuring that I get at least 30 minutes of Zone 2 exercise to sustain better levels of VO2max. Diet for me is mostly about what I remove, but I need to work at getting most of emotional support from things like martial arts solo drills, weight lifting, mobility drills to maintain my [physical health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/4/), so that I can have a decent level of cognitive, emotional, spiritual health.

5) MELONCAVE ... 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/day or an 90 minutes/weekday is stopping the bad habits of being myself, renunciation of stupidity as well as removing crutches and little bad habits ...  starting with example of fasting challenges, eg Lent and not just other parts of a fast-mimicking lifestyles but more time in prayer/contemplation rather than eating, optimizing biochemistry by cutting out the crap ... this but avoids most additives and supplements ... being sure to get the just right amount of sunlight, and all kinds of "cave in the melon" of the demons stuff about [renunciation of comfort, laziness and gluttony](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/5/).

6) MATRICULATION [and measuring]... 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/week or an 90 minutes/day is allocated to autodidactic learning, which means studying completely new topics, reading pre-print papers and [gathering new business/tech intelligence](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/6/). If I don't spend the time matriculating and measuring my success in learning something [by making something work, passing a certification exam or some other measurement traceable to a verifiable standard] then all kinds of things fall apart, eg I can't meet new people; I can't maintain my stuff, I can't work on AI/machines to make my life easier.

7) MINDFULNESS ... 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/week goes or 90 minutes/day to improving my mindfulness, coherence, clarity and cognitive awareness [of my cognitive awareness] to ensure that I stay on the path to becoming the kind of person that I want to be ... MINDFULNESS is primarily about meditative prayer walks and a range of meditation and breathwork exercises in my [Christiaan Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/7/) repertoire.

8) MOMENTUM ... 6% of my energy/focus/time or 7 hours/week or an hour/day goes to maintaining momentum and that comes through [sleep hygiene and everything necessary to ensure good rest](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/8/).  This was not always obvious, ie I used to be one of those "I sleep when I'm dead" kind of guys, but good sleep is about allowing the subconscious brain to rest and unravel all of the knots, paradoxes and puzzles. Getting good sleep for me depends upon *having my house in order* so that I can just sleep; doing this is just simply little average things like  5S activities, putting my tools and books and stuff in order, puttering in my kitchen or garage, various housekeeping chores and everything else that I need do beforehand to put my life in order to set the stage for optimizing my sleep during the 56 hrs/week I spend sleeping.

9) MONEY ... 6% of my energy/focus/time or 7 hours/week or an hour/day is devoted to correspondence, business, bills, managing investments, taxes and [financial health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/9/). I do not enjoy this part of the day, at all -- except for getting it done. I basically hate money and detest spending time with people who chase money, but I gotta *keep the lights on* and pay my bills. I wish I could spend zero time to this chore ... but it has to be taken care of, or else ...

10) MAINTENANCE ... About 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/week ... 1 per weekday and 3 on Sunday, since Sunday is my "wrap my head around the bs and sort through the stuff causing chaos day" ... you could also say that this is my MISCELLANEOUS JUNK box to collect everything that doesn't fit into the other priorities ... MAINTENANCE is for the stuff that I didn't really plan or think about before, but things have a way of bubbling up -- so I need to acknowledge that some of my time is just going to need to go to uncategorized miscellaneous stuff to sort through and address ... it's not all bad, many more unexpected GREAT things pop up than negative ones ... but the surprises that have to be planned/timeblocked and [miscellaneous things that haven't yet forced me to re-categorize my 9 priorities](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/A/). These surprises can be ignored if they are not important -- but if they actually are important, they will be urgent [and maybe BAD] when they arise again ... the time *lost* to these things is significant enough to demand it's own miscellaneous class, but they just don't neatly really fit under the other headings.
