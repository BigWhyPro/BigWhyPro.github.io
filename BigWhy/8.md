## 8th Priority

8) 6% of my energy/focus/time or 7 hours/week or an hour/day goes to [sleep hygiene and everything necessary to ensure good rest](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/8/). This is nothing more than 5S activities, putting things in order, puttering with my tools, various housekeeping chores and everything else that I need do beforehand to put my life in order to set the stage for optimizing my sleep during the 56 hrs/week I spend sleeping.
