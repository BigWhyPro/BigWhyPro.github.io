## 1st Priority 

1) 24% of my waking energy/focus/time or 27 hours/week, 12 on Sunday and 2 1/2 hours of every other day is allocated to keeping the Sabbath holy, keeping holy hour holy upon waking, attending Mass, bible study, journaling and [spiritual health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/Spiritual/). This is easily my favorite part of life; I sort of have to try not to spend all of my time on my highest priority because if I neglect the other areas, they have ways of becoming urgent and demanding.
