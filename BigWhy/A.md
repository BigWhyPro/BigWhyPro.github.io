## 10th Priority MAINTENANCE

About 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/week ... 1 hr per weekday and 3 hrs on Sunday [reading, thinkering, doing background research, not *skinning my knuckles on plumbing repairs*], since Sunday is my "*wrap my head around the bs and sort through the stuff that's maybe gonna chaos day*"-- it's REST or RELAXATION away from what I consider work.

You could also say that MAINTENANCE is effectively my MISCELLANEOUS JUNK box to collect everything that doesn't fit into the other priorities. MAINTENANCE is for the stuff that I didn't really plan or think about before and I'm not really going to ever be in the home repair or fix-it business but things have a way of bubbling up -- so I need to acknowledge that some of my time is just going to need to go to uncategorized miscellaneous stuff to sort through and address.

MAINTENANCE is not all bad, many more unexpected GREAT things pop up than negative ones ... but the surprises that have to be planned/timeblocked and [miscellaneous things that haven't yet forced me to re-categorize my whole list of priorities](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/0/). These surprises can be ignored if they are not important -- but if they actually are important, they will be urgent [and maybe BAD] when they arise again ... the time *lost* to these things is significant enough to demand it's own miscellaneous class, but they just don't neatly really fit under the other headings.

### Key MAINTEANCE Points

My prmimary interest, right now is older Homes, although I sorta wish that I didn't have to own a home ... I don't really have to own a vehicle anymore and that's liberating ... and my highest priority home renovation project would be my the bathroom and then addressing nagging issues with tree roots in the sewer drain ... I would probably leave HVAC install and electrician work to guys who do that, just because I don't find it at all entertaining ... the next highest priority is IT gear, higher-end performance workstations, primarily for AI work, but I might go back to CAD, computer vision stuff for microscopy/imaging of soil quality ... as you might guess, I spend far too much time looking into IT gear, memory, storage, comparing GPUs, etc -- I should just rent the capability, but it still intrigues me for reason that I cannot really explain.

There are almost too many experts on YouTube, social media, and blogs can help with remodeling older homes, especially bathrooms and plumbing projects Channels like This Old House and Home RenoVision DIY offer valuable content for these specific needs, but so do the commenters on their social media pages. I do not really know what I am doing in this realm, so I will look at A LOT of other guys for ideas ... AI really helps for this ... but I kinda lean toward going back popular name-brand influencers who have built a repuation doing this like Bob Vila and the Property Brothers being worth following for broader home improvement insights.

#### YouTube Channels

Here are 25 somewhat *preferred* [which is maybe too strong of a word; I definitely hesitate to say recommendeded] YouTube channels that specialize in home remodeling, with a focus on older homes, bathrooms, and plumbing projects. These channels provide tutorials, project walkthroughs, and expert advice ... AND through their social media presences or blogs, which is a really important source of entertainment for me, because it ALSO provide ways for frustrated homeowners to VENT, share useful insights and make observations about stuff to avoid at all costs.
