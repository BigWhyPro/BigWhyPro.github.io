## 4th Priority 

4) 8% of my energy/focus/time or 9 hours/week or 90 minutes/weekday goes to staying active, gardening, landscaping, different forms of exercise but ensuring that I get at least 30 minutes of Zone 2 exercise to sustain better levels of VO2max. Diet for me is mostly about what I remove, but I need to work at getting most of emotional support from things like martial arts solo drills, weight lifting, mobility drills to maintain my [physical health](https://bigwhypro.github.io/BigWhy/4/), so that I can have a decent level of cognitive, emotional, spiritual health.
