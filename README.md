KNOWING your WHY...means that you are continually journalling and re-mapping out the FULL Ishikawa cause-and-effect diagram for multiple facets of that WHY and at least five levels of WHY for each and every facet's branch.

## KNOWING your WHY

If you do not KNOW your WHY ... for any serious project that you are doing, you WILL fail.

If you are a mindless SWALLOWER ... your actions are a reflection of whims and ideas that pop into your head because you passively SWALLOW content ... you might see an exercise program on a YouTube channel that you follow and maybe you imagine that you would like to be like the person in the exercise program, so you start doing it ... you might even do some research about doing it the right way according to the best practices; you might even go to the trouble of becoming something of an expert or internet insta-expert on the topic ... but if you don't ***KNOW*** your why, you will fail ... people who pick STUPID goals, ie "I want to lose 30 lbs this year" will always fail, even if they temporarily succeed and accomplish the goal within their time limit, the gains will not be sustained ... ***because the goal is not connected to a serious WHY, which is mapped into the BIG WHY of one's existence.***

## The importance of continual journalling and concrete forms of ideation

Your ideas matter. *Well, sort of. * 

Ideas do matter, but ***NOT*** unless you go to the trouble of clarifying your thought [FOR YOUR LATER SELF, who might forget your temporary exuberance] and recording that thought FOR YOUR LATER SELF to revisit, revise, further clarify, modify, improve or disagree with.

If you don't write it down in some form of concrete record for yourself ... it ***effectively*** never happened ... your memory of your ideation is nothing but a shifting fantasy ... if you don't record it in some way that you can go back to and review, IT JUST NEVER HAPPENED ... stop IMAGINING that your memory is worth gaseous vapor it was printed on. It's probably best for most people to journal with a pen or crayons on paper ... to create a hard copy ... but for some, it might work better to journal electronically -- the ESSENTIAL requirement is that the record be something that you can go back to and review ... it is completely non-essential for your journal to be some intelligible work for any other human. It can be done with whatever media you find most useful ... but it has to be some record that you can go back and review.  Don't worry about it being lost ... if you go to the trouble of writing it down or recording it, your *memory* of it will be more fixed than if it is just the senile daydream of a child or crazy old person. A journal has to be something that you RECORD for your own later use; it does not have to be *permanent* for others to read. 

## The full Ishikawa

Your BIG WHY is effectively supported by multiple facets of supporting whys.  Those supporting whys REST upon your Big WHY ... but UNDERSTANDING your BIG WHY often results from really understanding the supporting whys ... it's a reflexive or recursive sort of thing.

Your supporting whys might fall under the following categories ... you will probably have [and should define] your own categories, but these following categories *sort of* illustrate how the different areas of your life support your main BIG WHY.

### Soul, Prayer, Meditation, Spiritual Environment, What Gives You Meaning and Peace

### Human Connections, Relationships, Ideas, Interests, Art, Music, Cultural Involvement

### Material Aspects of Lifestyle, Equipment and Technologies Used, What Stuff Does Your Life Depend On

### Measures Of Success/Failure, Risk/Uncertainty, Prosperity and Financial Independence

### Healthspan, Active Fitness and Balance, Nutrition and Diet, Sustained Well-Being

### Career, Profession, Creative Pursuits, Workflow, What Get's You Gets You Out Of Bed In The Morning?
